Here we present two scripts:

1. Cobertura.R

This script converts the long matrix that Photoquad gives to a wide ecological format.
Then combines certain variables to get the great groups of benthic cover.

2. Cobertura_total_tiempo.R

This script shows the steps for making the changes in abundance of benthic cover per quadrat during the 18 months experiments (Found at suplemental material of the paper).
