                             Historical cover


This README contains the steps that were made to produce the benthic cover and coral realtive cover camparissons.

The main information was obtained from:

(1)Villamizar, E. (2000). Estructura de una comunidad arrecifal en Falcón,        Venezuela, antes y después de una mortalidad masiva. Revista de                Biologia Tropical, 47, 19–30

(2) And from Verde et al., upublished, soon to be submited for peer           revision.

The main changes to the data were:

(1) Benthic community:

    All benthic categories were reduced to categories that combined all the     information from this studies to the must little resolution available in     all three times. 
    The categories that we decided to group all data were:

    Live coral cover
    Dead coral
    Gorgonids
    Sand
    Other invertebrates: All invertebrates that were not corals
    Algae: Turf, cianobacteria and felshy algae
    Abiotic substrate: contains rubble, dead coral, gaps.
    Other substrate: All other substrate that were not into all of previous                         categories


(2) Coral cover:
    All cover values from different coral species, but from the same genera     were summed to group them into genera.


Other changes:

The changes will be ordered depending on the year of the study

-------1995-------

Benthic cover:
    Modifications to the data: -Sum categories to group them chosen groups.
    Data found in: Villamizar et al., 2000 Table 3

Coral relative cover:
    Modifications to the data: -Sum categories to group them into genera.
    Data found in: Villamizar et al., 2000. Page 22. Second column, first                         parragraph.

-------1996-------
Benthic relative cover:
    Modifications to the data: -Sum categories to group them chosen groups.
    Data found in: Villamizar et al., 2000 Table 5

Coral relative cover: 
    Modifications to the data: -Transformed to relative coral cover (i.e.,                                      coral cover was 100%) 
                                -Sum categories to group them into genera.          Data found in: Villamizar et al., 2000. Table 6.

------2017-------
Benthic cover: 
    Modifications to the data:-Sum categories to group them chosen groups.
    Data found: Miyazawa et al., upublished

Coral relative cover: 
    Modifications: -As transect four didn't have any coral cover, we                               transformed the coral relative cover to be relative as                          75% was 100%.
                   -Sum categories to group them into genera.
    Data found: Miyazawa et al., upublished
