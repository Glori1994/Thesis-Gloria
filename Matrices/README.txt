This folder contains the three main matrices that make all the analysis possible for this article.

(1) Matriz Madre:
It contains information about abundance of juvenile corals, recruitmente, survivorship of juvenile corals and recruits and area meassurements (growth) of each individual.

This data comes from the visual inspection of each quadrat (you can find them at: https://sketchfab.com/gloria_mb/models). The abundance data was obtained as a visual census , the recruitment was obtained counting the newly arrived individuals from one time to another, the survivorship was calculated as the individuals present in time 4 and 1, and the area measurements were taken in Agisoft Photoscan Software for each individual.


(2) Rugosidad:

This matrix contains the ratio between the area of each quadrat3D  model at each time and the orthomosaic (orto projection) of each quadrat at each time (Ferrari et al., 2016). The 3D area was calculated with Agisoft software (models available at:https://sketchfab.com/gloria_mb/model)  and the 2D area was calculated with Photoquad software with the orthomosaics produced by Agisoft Software (the orthomosaics are available in this repository in the folder "Ortomosaicos" contained in "Quadrats benthic cover"

(3) Cobertura_final_3:

The benthic cover of each quadrat in each time. The information regardin to this matrix is at the folder "R cobertura", contained at "Matrices" at "Quadrat benthic cover".
